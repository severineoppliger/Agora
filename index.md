# Agora - Documentation
**Welcome to the documentation of Agora, my Bachelor's project.**  
This project was developed by SÃ©verine Oppliger as part of her final year studies for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Here, you will find all the information needed to understand the codebase and the project as a whole.

## About Agora
Agora is a community platform designed for the university environment, enabling students, staff, and alumni to exchange services. Users offer their time and skills in return for a virtual currency called Kairos. Kairos is strictly based on the time invested by users, regardless of the type of service provided, ensuring fairness across the platform. Upon registration, each user receives an initial allocation of Kairos to start trading.

Agora's backend is developed using the .NET framework, leveraging its robust features for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Documentation Scope
This site mainly hosts the automatically generated API documentation from the source code using XML comments. You can find it under the *API* tab.

While there is a *Docs* section available, it is currently not used for additional manual documentation. The primary focus is to provide a clear and accessible reference for the codebase.
